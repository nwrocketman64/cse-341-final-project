# Overview
This is the final project for CSE 341 class as a photo album web
application.

# Features
The features of this application include a standard login system that
allow a user to create an account and then login to that account. A
file upload system that lets the user upload a photo. The photo is not
saved on the server but instead saved in the database. A couple of
other views that let the user see the list of photos uploaded to that
account and let the user view the details of those photos. This web
application also has other features that you would see in other web
applications like csrf protection.

# Development Environment
I used VS code as the main IDE for creating the source code. I used
the Windows version of node.js for development and EJS as the main
rendering engine. The libraries that I used to make this application
work include bcrypt, csurf, express, multer, and mongoose.
